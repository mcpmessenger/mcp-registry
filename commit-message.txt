fix: Forward HTTP headers from metadata when invoking HTTP-based MCP tools

Fixed critical bug where HTTP headers (like X-Goog-Api-Key for Google Maps) 
were not being passed when invoking HTTP-based MCP servers.

Changes:
- Updated invokeHttpTool to extract httpHeaders from server metadata
- Merge metadata headers with default Content-Type header
- Added logging to verify API keys are being passed
- Created GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY_SETUP.md guide

This fixes 403 PERMISSION_DENIED errors when using Google Maps MCP Grounding
Lite through the LangChain orchestrator or direct tool invocations.

The headers stored in registry metadata.httpHeaders are now properly forwarded
to HTTP-based MCP servers like Google Maps.
